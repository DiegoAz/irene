## C. How to implement the Socratic method?
{% include "components/go-back.liquid", text:hyperlinks.goToTop[page.lang] %}

Implementing the Socratic method in environments where constructive dialogue is encouraged requires following a series of steps that guide participants through a process of analysis and reflection. The estimated time for the activity is one hour. Below is a simple methodology to apply this approach.

I.  **Preparatory Activity** {.inline}

    The initial reflection and participation guidelines outlined below can be read in turns by the participants. Any questions that arise can be answered as the discussion progresses. To foster discussion, additional questions may be asked, such as: "What is an opinion?" "What is an argument?" "What do we mean by 'active listening'?" "Do we know how to engage in constructive dialogue?" etc. {.block}

    **Initial reflection**: The teacher, workshop leader, or facilitator should start with a reflection to encourage participants to question how they interact with the opinions of others. The following text may be used: {.block}

    <div class=guiding-text>

    *Often, we do not agree with the opinions of our family, friends, colleagues, or peers. But how can we be so sure that person is wrong? Have we ever asked them why they think that way? Have we taken the time to carefully analyze their arguments? Are our emotions or our reasoning telling us that they are wrong?* {.block}
    
    *The Socratic method is a way of learning to find consensus through dialogue. It is not an easy task, but if we use active listening, respect others beyond their opinions, analyze before passing judgment based on fleeting emotions, and express ourselves with well-founded arguments, the results may surprise us.* {.block}

    **Participation Guidelines**: For the Socratic dialogue to be effective, it is essential to establish a set of participation guidelines that ensure mutual respect and the smooth exchange of ideas. These guidelines help all participants feel comfortable expressing their opinions and ensure the process is constructive and collaborative. Below are some basic rules that can be adapted to each context: {.block}

    1. **Raise your hand to speak**: All participants should raise their hand to ask for the floor before speaking. This ensures order in the discussion and allows everyone to be heard without interruptions. {.inline}

    2. **Brief and clear interventions:** Interventions should be concise and well-supported. Avoid speaking too long to give others the opportunity to participate. A good intervention includes a clear argument and, if possible, supporting evidence. {.inline}

    3. **Respect for opinions of others:** It is essential that each participant listens actively and respects the opinions of others, even if they disagree. Disagreements should be expressed respectfully, using phrases like "In my opinion, I believe that..." or "I think there is another perspective..." {.inline}

    4. **Avoid interruptions:** Do not interrupt the person speaking. All opinions are important. Waiting your turn to speak demonstrates respect for others and their ideas. {.inline}

    5. **Use appropriate language:** Language must be respectful and appropriate for the setting. Avoid raising your voice, insulting, or making personal attacks that could offend others. The goal is to foster constructive dialogue, not confrontation. {.inline}

    6. **Focus on arguments, not people:** Discussions should focus on the arguments, not the person presenting them. Avoid personalizing criticisms or making comments that attack colleagues instead of their ideas. {.inline}

    7. **Keep an open mind:** Participants should be willing to reconsider their own points of view in light of the arguments presented by others. The Socratic method is a collective analytic process where everyone can learn and contribute to mutual understanding. {.inline}

II. **Explication of the Socratic Method** {.inline}

   {% guideThirdImage "In the participants' guide, which is attached to this document, a brief biography of Socrates and a simple explanation of the Socratic method are included. It is recommended that this part of the guide be read in turns by the participants, which will allow for a better understanding of the method and encourage discussion from the outset. By reading Socrates’ story, participants will be able to ask questions, understand the purpose of Socratic dialogue, and learn how to apply it in the process of reflection and conflict resolution." %}


III.  **Implementation of the Adapted Socratic Method** {.inline .clearfix}

      1. **Initial Question**

          After completing the preparatory activity and explaining the Socratic method, an initial statement should be chosen to spark debate, adapted to the context in which the method will be implemented. It is crucial that this statement be carefully selected to promote a rich and participatory discussion. {.block}

          The statement should be incomplete, ambiguous, or lead to a false conclusion, known as a 'fallacy.' The purpose of this selection is to create a polarizing starting point, so that participants, through their interventions, are motivated to soften, clarify, or question the strength of the statement. This encourages participants to examine different perspectives and work towards consensus as the dialogue develops. {.block}

          For example, a statement like: “To achieve peace, one side must give in to the other’s interests,” could be used. In this case, the formulation invites participants to offer differing points of view, contrast with personal experiences, or find examples that challenge or modify the initial statement, thus promoting a dynamic and reflective discussion. {.block}

          The statement may be proposed by the teacher, workshop leader, facilitator, or ideally, by one of the participants. Other examples of provocative statements include: {.block}

          - Intelligence is something innate and cannot be developed.
          - Happiness is related to the amount of money a person has.
          - Success is only possible if you have connections.

          - Democracy is the only system of government that works.
          - Formal education is the only way to achieve professional success.
          - Forgiveness benefits the offender, not the victim.
          - Traditions should not change because they define our identity.
          - Revenge is a just response to an injustice.
          - Hard work is the only factor that defines success.
          - Emotions should not play a role in important decisions.
          - Laws must be obeyed without question.

          - Failure is a clear sign that someone is not capable enough.
          - People are poor because they want to be.
          - Respect must be earned, not given freely.
          - People who make serious mistakes do not deserve second chances.
          - Neutrality is the best option in any conflict.
          - Physical appearance reflects our values.
          - Being a man means being strong.
          - Natural resources are inexhaustible.
          - Good people are obedient.
          - People demand rights but avoid responsibilities.
          - An unjust peace is better than a just war.
          - If you want peace, prepare for war.
          - If everyone does it, it must be right.
          - Majorities are never wrong.
          - If you avoid talking about the problem, it will eventually disappear on its own.

      2. **Opinions**

          Participants take turns expressing their opinions on the initial statement. These should be recorded concisely on a board or a visible screen for everyone. If these resources are not available, one or two participants can be assigned as secretaries, who will note down the opinions in a notebook or on a mobile device. {.block}

      3. **Validation and Refutation**

          Once all opinions have been expressed, the process of validation and refutation begins. Each participant, in turn, will evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the previous opinions. It is essential to explain that all opinions have at least one weakness and one strength. Additionally, it should be emphasized that the language used must avoid hurting the  feelings of others. Participants may be advised to use expressions such as: {.block}

          <img src="{{ images.five.src }}" alt="{{ images.five.alt[page.lang] }}" class="{{ images.five.classes | join: ' ' }}" id="{{ images.five.id }}">


          - Unfortunately, I cannot agree with your opinion because...
          - I respectfully disagree with this stance because...
          - I find this idea problematic, because ...
          - I believe there are better alternatives, such as...
          - I understand what you are saying, but it seems to me that…


      4. **Reformulation** {.clearfix}

          After validation and refutation, the group should reformulate the original statement, integrating the strengths of the different points of view. If consensus is not reached, steps **2 (Opinions)**, **3 (Validation and Refutation)**, and **4 (Reformulation)** are repeated. It is important to remind participants that it is not always possible to reach an immediate agreement and that more sessions may be needed to achieve it. It is also important to emphasize that the value of the exercise lies in critical reflection and the continuous process of dialogue, as the exchange of opinions allows us to move towards consensuses that facilitate peaceful coexistence by respecting and valuing our differences. {.block}
