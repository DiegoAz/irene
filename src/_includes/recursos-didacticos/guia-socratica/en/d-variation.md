The activity can be divided into several sessions, depending on what the teacher, workshop leader, or facilitator deems appropriate. To enrich the dialogue, participants can be assigned a reading or a video related to the topic, so that they come to the discussion with more context and well-formed opinions.

If the group does not achieve a complete reformulation of the initial statement in the first session, it can be postponed to the next session. During this time, participants can commit to researching more about the topic, which will allow them to refine their arguments and contribute more effectively in the next stage of the dialogue. It is recommended that the supplementary sessions do not exceed one hour.
