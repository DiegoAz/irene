    This guide presents an adaptation of the Socratic method for conflict resolution. Its primary goal is to raise awareness about the importance of constructive dialogue, critical analysis, and the search for consensus. The guide also aims to motivate people to create spaces for exchanging ideas where participants can challenge their own assumptions and those of others. The dialogical process seeks to build a collective understanding that respects the diversity of perspectives and avoids the imposition of opinions. Participants are expected not only to learn how to lead a dialogue but also to negotiate and reach consensus, essential skills for harmonious coexistence. This guide is designed for any group of people interested in facilitating dialogue, since it can be applied in various contexts: {.block}

    - **In the community:** It allows people to discuss local issues and seek joint solutions.
    - **In the family environment:** It helps improve communication and resolve misunderstandings between family members or friends.
    - **In the workplace:** It facilitates conflict resolution among coworkers.

II. **Who Was Socrates?** {.inline}

    Socrates is one of the most important philosophers in the history of Western philosophy. He was born in Athens, Greece, in 469 B.C., almost 2,500 years ago. Although little is known about his childhood and youth, it is believed that his father was a sculptor and his mother a midwife. Socrates did not leave any written works, so most of what we know about him comes from the writings of his disciples, especially Plato. {.block}

    Unlike many philosophers of his time, Socrates did not focus on studying nature or the universe but on moral and ethical issues. Socrates believed that knowledge and wisdom were the keys to living a good and virtuous life. He was known for his teaching style. Instead of giving direct answers to his interlocutors, he asked questions to make them reflect and arrive at their conclusions. {.block}

    Socrates had many disciples and followers, but he also had enemies. His ideas and teachings challenged the realities of his time, so Socrates was sentenced to death for blasphemy and corrupting the youth of Athens. His accusers believed he was introducing new gods and leading the youth away from democracy. He was forced to drink a cup of hemlock, a poisonous drink that led to his death in 399 B.C. Despite these unjust accusations, Socrates' life and teachings have influenced many later philosophers and thinkers. His vision of ethics and the importance of knowledge and wisdom remain relevant today.

III.    **What Is the Socratic Method?** {.inline}

        The Socratic method is a process of dialogue and reasoning based on the confrontation of ideas through questions and answers. Instead of quickly reaching a conclusion, the goal is to delve deeper into the analysis of a topic through the exchange of different perspectives. This method encourages active listening, critical reflection, and respect for the opinions of others. Through this process, participants question their ideas and those of others, which allows consensus-building and arriving at solutions that integrate a diversity of opinions. {.block}

IV. **How can we apply the Socratic Method to Conflict Resolution?** {.inline}

    <div class="img-container">

    Before beginning the discussion, it is important to prepare to listen without prejudice. Often, we disagree with the opinions of others. However, how can we be so sure that person is wrong? Have I ever taken the time to analyze their arguments? Are my emotions or my reasoning telling me that they are mistaken? The first step is to question our own assumptions and open ourselves to dialogue. The Socratic method is not about winning or losing an argument but about enriching mutual understanding. During the activity, everyone must respect the following rules: {.block}
    </div>

    - **Active listening:** Pay attention without interrupting others.
    - **Brief and clear interventions:** Express your ideas concisely and respectfully.
    - **Focus on arguments:** Critique or support ideas, not the people presenting them.

    With the help of the teacher, workshop leader, or facilitator we follow the steps below: 

    a. **Initial question:** A statement is posed on a topic we want to analyze. For example, "To achieve peace, one side must give in to the interests of others."

    b. **Opinions:** Each participant briefly expresses their opinion on the statement and records it in a notebook, agenda, phone, or other available medium.

    c. **Validation and refutation:** We will now examine the strengths and weaknesses of the statements, always with the utmost respect.

    d. **Reformulation:** Using the strengths of the statements, we will try to build a new statement with which everyone agrees.

    e. **If no consensus is reached**, we will repeat steps **b) Opinions**, **c) Validation and refutation**, and **d) Reformulation**.


V.  **Final Reflection** {.inline}

    It may be necessary to repeat these steps several times, even in multiple sessions, as some topics are challenging to address. However, dialogue will help us understand why it is so challenging and, at the same time, recognize the value of the opinions of others and the shortcomings of our own. We conclude by answering the following questions: How did you feel during the discussion process? How would you describe the process of trying to reach a consensus? Did you find it useful? {.block}
